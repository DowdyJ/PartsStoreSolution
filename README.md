# Parts Store Web App
This project is my final project submission for the Java Frameworks course at WGU. 

This project creates a web app for simple parts shop using the Java Spring framework. You can add, remove, and update items in the inventory, create a cart with items and submit your mock purchase. You can add constraints for minimum and maximum sotred inventory counts for each of the parts in the database using the GUI.

## Running the Solution
You will need Java SDK/JRE 18.0+ installed to run the solution.

In the root folder of the solution, run `./mvnw spring-boot:run` (`.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run` in Windows)

Once the solution is running, you can use the webapp by navigating to http://localhost:8080/.

## Acknowledgements
A large portion of the original project was provided by WGU. Substantial additions and changes were made for the project.
